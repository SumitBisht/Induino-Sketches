This project contains various sketches that I have made in my spare time.
Please consider adding comments/forking this repo. if you have somthing to share and improve upon this.
The scripts given here will also work on standard arduino boards too, but pin number configurations would have to be modified accordingly.
The scripts have been tested on my device, but execution of scripts should be done at your own descretion.
I am not liable for any damages to the device, user or programming tools arising out of usage of these scripts.
